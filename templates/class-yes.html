        <div class="item">This cool little attention getter is going to be one of the ways I will get yours and your
            classmates attention. The way it works is like this, here is a scenerio:
        </div>
        <div class="item">*class is talking to one another about what we are doing that day*</div>
        <div class="item">Mr. Burr: Class classity class class</div>
        <div class="item">Class: Yes yessity yes yes</div>
        <div class="item">*Class is silent so now I can speak*</div>
        <div class="last-item">So as you can see what you can see is that whatever way the teacher, in this case me, Mr.
            Burr, says "class" the class will say it back in the same exact way.

        <li class="item">We will rehearse this by having all of you wonderful students talking to one another then I will
                        say "class" in some way and you will respond "yes" in the same manner. We will practice this until
                        we get quiet within 5 seconds.</li>
