            <li class="item">I will be standing in front of my door, ready to great you with a smile and saying "Welcome
                Back! Go
                ahead to your desk and get started on your Brain Sweat activity." I only do this because you may be
                having an off day and you just need a little bit of reminding on the procedures.
            </li>
            <li class="item">If there was any homework the night before, I will also remind you to go ahead and put it
                on your desk so that way my collector can go around and pick up your homework and place
                it inside of the "I Did Stuff at Home" tray.

            <li class="last-item">If you had to get something signed (field trip form, parent notes, etc.) you can put
                it in the "Nitty Gritty" tray and I'll
                remind you of that too as you walk in. This will be at the corner of my desk. Next to this
                will be some envelopes and I will kindly ask you to put your forms or field trip money in
                there with your name on top of it please. I would hate to either lose something, or someone
                getting into your privacy.

            <li class="item">When you are in the room, if you are allowed to have a backpack, go ahead and take out
                your need materials for the day and place them under your desk or chair. I would hate for

                each of my students to respect a speaker by listening quietly.
